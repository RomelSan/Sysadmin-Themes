Notes:
Keep in mind that some colors are not visible under dark themes.

To test the theme then do this inside a SSH connection using Kitty.
```
whiptail --yesno Hello 10 50 --title TitleBox --backtitle BackTitle
mc
htop
top
```
Test each of those commands and take a look at the colors and text.
I suggest to do this first on a default settings without customizations so you can compare.

* If you are building your own theme then you can use the file 'ansi.sh' to print out the color map.
